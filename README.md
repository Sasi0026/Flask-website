# Flask-website
Building my personal portfolio website using Flask to showcase my development skills [ Learning + Execution]
# My Personal Portfolio Website

## Project Description

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website. The website is being developed using the **Flask** web framework in Python.

The primary goal of this project is to showcase my development skills through practical application while simultaneously serving as a hands-on learning experience for building web applications with Flask.

This project follows a **"[Learning + Execution]"** methodology, where I aim to learn and implement at least one simple feature or concept related to Flask and web development each day.

## Goal of the Project

The main goals are:

1.  To build a functional and aesthetically pleasing personal portfolio website to showcase my projects, skills, and experience.
2.  To deeply learn and understand the Flask framework by actively using it to implement various website features.
3.  To practice breaking down a larger project into smaller, daily, achievable tasks.
4.  To create a tangible project that demonstrates my ability to learn new technologies and execute a web development project from start to finish.

## Learning Methodology

I am approaching this project by focusing on implementing **one simple feature daily**. This method helps reinforce learning through immediate application and keeps the development process manageable and consistent. Each day involves:

* Identifying a small, specific feature or concept to learn/implement (e.g., setting up a route, displaying dynamic data, integrating a template, handling form input).
* Researching and learning how to achieve it using Flask.
* Writing and integrating the code for that feature into the project.
* Testing the implemented feature.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The core programming language.
* **Flask:** The micro web framework used for building the application backend.
* **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** For the frontend structure, styling, and interactivity.
* **Git:** For version control.
* **GitHub:** For hosting the repository and project management (Kanban board).

## Features (Planned & Implemented)

This section will be updated as the project progresses.

**Planned Features:**

* Homepage with a brief introduction.
* "About Me" section.
* Projects showcase page (displaying different projects).
* Contact form.
* Skill listing.
* Resume/CV link or display.
* Responsive design for various devices.
